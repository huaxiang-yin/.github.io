Hi! I’m a fourth-year DS undergrad at [NUIST](https://en.nuist.edu.cn/main.htm). I will be a CS master of [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/) this year.

My research interests mainly focus on deap learning and computer vision. I am always open to new topics.

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](http://yuqi-miao.github.io/files/CN-CV.pdf).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
